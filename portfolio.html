        <dd>He was part of the Knowledge Management Unit team which I managed (together with Emanuele Costa) at the University of Central Asia. I sought to apply the Unit's skills to support activities throughout the University and enhance research initiatives. Elaman was a key member of the team. He was always eager to take on new activities, he worked well with colleagues and managed his tasks in a timely and orderly manner. he could be relied upon to take on challenging tasks and sought help from colleagues when he needed assistance. His skills grew during this period and he broadened his network. Elaman has a good command of English and is able to communicate freely with others. I am glad to to see how his career has grown and would recommend him to potential employers.</dd>

        <dd>I hired him while serving as Head of Knowledge Management at the University of Central Asia and I can confidently say he was one of my best hire to date. He is very smart, reliable and can learn new technical skills at an amazing pace. He also shown a level of proactivity difficult to find in young engineers. On a personal note he is an extremely polite and fun character fitting well in team work.</dd>
