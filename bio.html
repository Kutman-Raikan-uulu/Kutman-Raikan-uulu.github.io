      <h1> About me</h1>

<p>I (Kutman) know that I am special and there's no one else out there that's like me... so enjoy! (smile)
</p>
<p>I was born in Karakol on May 26, 1999. I had a very simple and happy childhood, and my only sibling, my younger Brother, would appear nine years later after my own birth.</p>

<p>Like my dad, I am introverted and am perfectly happy watching quality movies or using a personal computer during my spare time.I lived in Bishkek. For one year before I came back to Karakol, I lived in Frankfurt.
